    <summary>About Me</summary>
    <p>Hi! I'm Veer Mahajan, a high school student in California. I've been interested in math since elementary school, and have been equally interested in teaching it to others. This led me to create my own YouTube channel (linked above) where I shared my love for mathematics through lessons and practice problems. This website is an extension of that adventure, and is meant to make math not only easy, but enjoyable.</p>

    <summary>About This Website</summary>
    <p>I created my first website in fifth grade and made it a home for my YouTube videos, organized by difficulty and theme. As I've created more and more videos, particularly for high school math courses, I've kept on updating and improving upon the website. In its current state, relatively few videos are featured here, mainly tailored to students in intermediate algebra, precalculus, and calculus courses. Besides videos, there are also several other "lessons" given, alongside numerous practice problems. If you'd like something more interactive, check out the various timed quizzes, meant to simulate the pressure of a real testing environment. All videos are organized by their topics, and you can find them by clicking on the buttons at the top of this homepage. </p>
